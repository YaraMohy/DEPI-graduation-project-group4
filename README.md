DEPI Graduation Project: Vulnerability Analysis and Penetration Testing on Monitors3 (HTB) and Relevant Machine (TryHackMe)

This repository contains our graduation project for the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative, where we specialize in the Vulnerability Analyst / Penetration Tester track. The objective of our project was to solve and thoroughly analyze two specific machines—Monitors3 from Hack The Box and a relevant machine from TryHackMe. Both machines simulate vulnerable environments, allowing us to apply advanced penetration testing techniques to identify, exploit, and document security weaknesses.

Project Highlights: Objective and Setup: Establish secure lab environments on Hack The Box and TryHackMe to simulate realistic testing conditions. Vulnerability Identification: Detailed vulnerability scans, using industry-standard tools, to identify and understand each machine's exploitable points. Exploit Execution: Applying ethical hacking practices to exploit identified vulnerabilities, documenting attack paths, and demonstrating the risk posed by these weaknesses. Reporting and Documentation: This repository contains comprehensive reports on each machine, outlining each phase—from discovery to exploitation and suggested remediation strategies. These reports offer a structured approach to tackling complex vulnerabilities, providing insights for security professionals and enthusiasts.
